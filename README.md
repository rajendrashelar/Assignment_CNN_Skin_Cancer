## General Information
- Problem statement: Build a CNN based model to accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
- All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant
- Dataset of about 2357 images (JPG format) of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. 
- The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.

## Conclusions
- With addtional interations and adding more samples, model is able to provide optimum results. 
- Keras from TensorFlow library are used to achive the desired results. 
- Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks
- TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence
